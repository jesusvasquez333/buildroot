Special Quirks:
 - add '-T 5 -t 10' to udhcpc command line options (bb configuration)
   the express-lpc board or linux driver seems to have a problem: the
   interface needs to be up for ~20s before anything gets across.
   (The same problem occurred inside iPXE which we had to patch).
   But HEY: this could also be caused by the switch?!
